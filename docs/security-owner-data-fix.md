# 🔒 Security Fix: Company Owner Personal Data Protection

## ✅ **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Issue**: Company Business Information Could Be Stolen by Competitors
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Owner personal data completely separated and secured

## 📋 **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **Data Separation Architecture**
- **Removed** all owner personal data from main `companies` table
- **Created** separate `company_owner_details` table with ultra-restrictive access
- **Implemented** field-level security to protect sensitive information

### 2. **Owner Personal Data Protected**
The following sensitive fields are now completely isolated:
- ✅ `owner_name` - Personal identity information
- ✅ `owner_email` - Personal contact details  
- ✅ `owner_phone` - Personal phone numbers
- ✅ `owner_title` - Personal business titles

### 3. **Ultra-Secure Access Control**
**`company_owner_details` table**:
- 🔒 **Access**: Only company owners and superadmins
- 🔒 **Visibility**: Completely hidden from other users
- 🔒 **Operations**: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE strictly controlled
- 🔒 **Audit**: All access logged for compliance

### 4. **Secure Data Views Created**

**`companies_secure`** - Safe for all company users:
- Business information (name, address, phone, email)
- Financial data (EIN, DOT/MC numbers, percentages)
- Operational data (plan type, status, settings)
- ❌ **NO owner personal information**

**`companies_with_owner_info`** - Restricted access only:
- Complete company data + owner personal details
- ✅ Only company owners and superadmins
- ✅ Full audit trail for access

## 🛡️ **Security Improvements**
