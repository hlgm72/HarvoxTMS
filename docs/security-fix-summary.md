# Security Fix Summary: Company Financial Data Protection

## 🔒 Issue Resolved
**Critical Security Vulnerability**: Company Financial Data Could Be Stolen

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Role-Based Data Access Control**
- Created separate secure views for different access levels:
  - `companies_public`: Basic company info for all company users
  - `companies_financial`: Sensitive financial data for owners/operations managers only

### 2. **Enhanced RLS Policies**
- Restricted main `companies` table access to company owners and superadmins only
- Added security definer functions to prevent RLS recursion issues
- Implemented granular permission checking based on user roles

### 3. **Data Classification**
**Public View (`companies_public`)** - Safe for all company users:
- Company name, address, phone, email
- Logo URL, plan type, status
- Creation/update timestamps

**Financial View (`companies_financial`)** - Restricted access:
- EIN numbers (tax identification)
- Owner personal information
- Financial percentages (factoring, dispatching, leasing)
- DOT/MC numbers
- Payment configurations
- Contract details

### 4. **Application Code Updates**
Updated the following components to use secure views:
- `useSuperAdminDashboard.ts`: Uses `companies_financial` for superadmin access
- `useUserCompanies.tsx`: Uses `companies_public` for basic company lists
- `Companies.tsx`: Uses `companies_financial` for admin operations
- `Settings.tsx`: Uses `companies_financial` for settings access
- `OwnerDashboard.tsx`: Uses `companies_financial` for owner dashboard

## 🛡️ Security Improvements

### Before Fix:
- All company users could access sensitive financial data
- EIN numbers, owner personal info, and financial percentages were exposed
- Single RLS policy allowed broad access

### After Fix:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only see data they need
- **Role-Based Access**: Financial data restricted by user role
- **Audit Ready**: Clear data access patterns for compliance
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect sensitive data
