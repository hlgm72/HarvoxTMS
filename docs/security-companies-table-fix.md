# Security Fix: Enhanced Company Data Protection

## Issue Fixed
**Critical Security Vulnerability**: The `companies` table contained sensitive business information (EIN tax IDs, DOT numbers, email addresses, phone numbers, street addresses) that could be accessed by hackers to commit identity theft or fraud.

## Root Cause
The RLS policies on the `companies` table were too permissive, allowing access to sensitive financial and personal business information that should be restricted to authorized personnel only.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced RLS Policies
- **Replaced** broad access policy with restrictive `companies_basic_info_members_only` policy
- **Removed** overly permissive policies that exposed sensitive data
- **Added** field-level access control through security functions

### 2. Security Functions Created
- **`can_access_company_sensitive_data()`**: Validates if user can access sensitive fields (EIN, DOT, financial data)
- **`log_sensitive_company_access()`**: Audit logging for all sensitive data access
- **Enhanced RPC functions** with proper logging and authorization checks

### 3. Access Control Matrix for Sensitive Data
| Data Type | Driver | Dispatcher | Operations Manager | Company Owner | Superadmin |
|-----------|--------|------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| Company Name, Address | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Phone, Email | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| EIN, DOT, MC Numbers | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Financial Settings | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

### 4. Security Features Implemented
- **Field-Level Security**: Sensitive fields are protected by additional authorization checks
- **Audit Logging**: All access to sensitive company data is logged with user details and timestamps
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions based on user roles within companies
- **Company Isolation**: Users can only access data from their own company (except superadmins)
- **Authentication Requirements**: All access requires valid user authentication

## Before vs After
- **Before**: All company members could access EIN, DOT numbers, owner details, and financial information
- **After**: Only authorized roles (operations managers, company owners, superadmins) can access sensitive data
- **Security**: Enhanced with audit logging and strict permission validation
- **Compliance**: Improved data protection and privacy controls

## Security Validation
- **RLS Policies**: ✅ Properly configured and restrictive
- **Access Control**: ✅ Role-based permissions enforced
- **Audit Trail**: ✅ All sensitive data access logged
- **Data Protection**: ✅ Sensitive fields require explicit authorization

## Impact Assessment
- **Security**: ✅ Critical vulnerability resolved
- **Functionality**: ✅ Legitimate business operations preserved
- **Performance**: ✅ Optimized with targeted security checks
- **Compliance**: ✅ Enhanced data protection standards

## Next Steps
- Monitor audit logs for any suspicious access patterns
- Review other sensitive data tables for similar vulnerabilities
- Consider implementing additional field-level encryption for highly sensitive data
- Regular security audits and policy reviews

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Customer data theft vulnerability successfully patched
