# Development Guidelines - FleetNest TMS

## Senior Software Engineer Standards
Act as a Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience in SaaS and Transportation Management Systems.

## Coding Standards

### Language and Structure
- **Language**: Write clean, modular, and well-documented code in **TypeScript + React + Tailwind**
- **Naming Convention**: Use **English only** for:
  - Variable names
  - Function names
  - Comments
  - Folder/file names
- **Architecture**: Ensure code follows **SOLID principles** and professional best practices
- **Documentation**: All code must be well-documented with clear comments

### Code Quality Requirements
- Modular design with single responsibility components
- Clean separation of concerns
- Professional-grade error handling
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Consistent formatting and structure

## Error Prevention Strategy

### Pre-Development Planning
1. **Outline the plan** before coding:
   - Files to modify
   - Reason for changes
   - Expected outcome
2. **Minimal impact**: Do not modify working modules unless strictly required
3. **Edge case validation**: Validate logic against:
   - Month boundaries
   - Leap years
   - Time zones
   - Daylight Saving Time (DST)
   - Data validation limits
   - Network failures

### Risk Mitigation
- Always validate inputs and outputs
- Handle async operations properly
- Consider performance implications
- Test with realistic data volumes

## Testing Requirements

### Test-First Approach
1. **Generate tests first**: Create unit tests and integration tests that define correct behavior
2. **Implement code**: Write or refactor code until all tests pass
3. **Provide proof**: Show test outputs as verification

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual functions/components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Edge case coverage
- Performance validation where applicable

## Standard Deliverables Format

For every development task, provide:

### 1. Minimal Change Plan
- List of files to be modified/created
- Justification for each change
- Expected outcomes
- Risk assessment

### 2. Code Implementation
- Clean, documented TypeScript/React code
- Following established patterns
- Proper error handling
- Type safety compliance

### 3. Test Suite with Results
- Comprehensive test coverage
- All tests passing
- Test output documentation
- Edge case validation

### 4. Short Changelog
- What was fixed or improved
- Impact on existing functionality
- Performance implications
- Breaking changes (if any)

## Error Handling Protocol

### When Blocked or Uncertain
1. **Stop immediately** - Do not guess or assume
2. **Explain the issue** clearly
3. **Propose at least 2 minimal alternative solutions**
4. **Wait for clarification** before proceeding

### Decision Making
- Prefer minimal changes over complex solutions
- Maintain existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change
- Choose solutions with lowest risk and highest maintainability
