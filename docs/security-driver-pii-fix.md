# Security Fix: Driver Personal Information Protection

## Issue Resolved
**Critical Security Vulnerability**: The `driver_profiles` table had overly permissive access controls that allowed operations managers to view highly sensitive driver personal information (PII), creating potential for identity theft and privacy violations.

## Root Cause
The original security model allowed **operations managers** to access all driver profile data, including:
- Driver license numbers
- Emergency contact information
- Personal identification details
- License state information

This violated the principle of least privilege and exposed sensitive PII to users who only needed basic operational information.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Access Control Functions

#### `can_access_driver_highly_sensitive_data()`
- **Restricted to**: Driver themselves, Company Owners, Superadmins
- **Blocks**: Operations Managers, Dispatchers, other roles
- **Protects**: License numbers, emergency contacts, personal IDs

#### `can_access_driver_operational_data()`
- **Allowed for**: Driver themselves, Operations Managers, Company Owners, Superadmins
- **Provides**: CDL class, license expiry dates, active status
- **Purpose**: Operational needs without exposing PII

### 2. Ultra-Restrictive RLS Policies

Updated `driver_profiles` table policies:
- **SELECT**: Only owners/superadmins can access full profiles with sensitive data
- **INSERT/UPDATE**: Only owners/superadmins can create/modify profiles (not operations managers)
- **DELETE**: Only superadmins (unchanged)

### 3. Secure Data Access Views

#### `driver_basic_info` View
- **Access Level**: Operations Manager and above
- **Fields**: `cdl_class`, `license_expiry_date`, `is_active`, timestamps
- **Purpose**: Operational management without PII exposure

#### `driver_sensitive_info` View  
- **Access Level**: Company Owner and Superadmin only
- **Fields**: All sensitive PII including license numbers, emergency contacts
- **Purpose**: Administrative and compliance needs

### 4. Enhanced Audit Logging

#### `log_driver_data_access_detailed()`
- **Field-Level Tracking**: Records exactly which fields were accessed
- **User Attribution**: Logs who accessed what data when
- **Access Type Classification**: Differentiates between basic vs sensitive access
- **Compliance Ready**: Provides audit trail for regulatory requirements

### 5. Secure RPC Functions

#### `get_driver_basic_info(target_user_id)`
- **Security**: Validates operational data access permissions
- **Logging**: Automatically logs access with field details
- **Returns**: Non-sensitive operational data only

#### `get_driver_sensitive_info(target_user_id)`
- **Security**: Ultra-restrictive - owners/superadmins only
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for PII access
- **Error Handling**: Clear access denied messages
- **Returns**: Complete sensitive driver information

## Security Improvements

### Before Fix
- ❌ Operations managers could access driver license numbers
- ❌ Emergency contact information exposed to unnecessary roles
- ❌ No field-level access tracking
- ❌ Single permission level for all driver data

### After Fix
- ✅ **Data Minimization**: Users only see data they need for their role
- ✅ **PII Protection**: Sensitive information restricted to owners/superadmins
- ✅ **Granular Permissions**: Basic operational vs highly sensitive data separation
- ✅ **Comprehensive Audit**: Field-level access logging for compliance
- ✅ **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access for each role

## Access Control Matrix

| User Role | Basic Info (CDL, Expiry) | Sensitive PII (License #, Emergency) | Profile Management |
|-----------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Driver | Own data only | Own data only | Own data only |
| Dispatcher | ❌ No access | ❌ No access | ❌ No access |
| Operations Manager | ✅ Company drivers | ❌ No access | ❌ No access |
| Company Owner | ✅ Company drivers | ✅ Company drivers | ✅ Company drivers |
| Superadmin | ✅ All companies | ✅ All companies | ✅ All companies |

## Business Impact

### Security Benefits
- **Identity Theft Prevention**: License numbers no longer exposed to operations staff
- **Privacy Compliance**: Meets GDPR/CCPA requirements for data minimization
- **Audit Readiness**: Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance
- **Incident Response**: Field-level tracking enables precise breach assessment

### Operational Benefits
- **Role Clarity**: Clear separation between operational and administrative access
- **Maintained Functionality**: Operations managers retain necessary operational data
- **Error Reduction**: Explicit permissions prevent accidental data exposure
- **Compliance Confidence**: Built-in audit logging for regulatory requirements

## Application Code Updates

### Updated Hooks
- `useSecureDriverProfiles.ts`: Enhanced with new security model and audit logging
- `useCanAccessDriverSensitiveData()`: Now ultra-restrictive (owners/superadmins only)
- `useCanAccessDriverOperationalData()`: New hook for basic operational data

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing `can_access_driver_sensitive_data()` function now calls the ultra-restrictive version
- Application code continues to work but with enhanced security
- Gradual migration path for components using direct table access

## Verification Steps

✅ **RLS Policy Testing**: Confirmed operations managers cannot access sensitive PII
✅ **Function Security**: Verified RPC functions enforce proper access controls  
✅ **Audit Logging**: Tested field-level access tracking and logging
✅ **Role Permissions**: Validated each role's access matches security matrix
✅ **Application Integration**: Confirmed enhanced hooks work with existing UI

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Security Monitoring
- Monitor `company_data_access_log` for unusual PII access patterns
- Alert on access denied attempts (potential unauthorized access)
- Review audit logs for compliance and security assessments

### Recommended Queries
```sql
-- Monitor sensitive PII access
SELECT * FROM company_data_access_log 
WHERE access_type LIKE '%driver_sensitive_pii%' 
ORDER BY accessed_at DESC;

-- Check for access denied attempts
SELECT * FROM company_data_access_log 
WHERE access_type LIKE '%denied%' 
AND action = 'driver_pii_access';
```

## Next Steps
1. **Training**: Educate operations staff on new access model
2. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for suspicious PII access patterns  
3. **Compliance**: Document security enhancements for regulatory audits
4. **Review**: Periodically assess if access controls remain appropriate

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Critical PII exposure vulnerability completely eliminated
